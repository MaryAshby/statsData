   We are so, so tired. But there is no rest for the wicked or the weary.         </p>
                        
    <p><i><b>Thou shalt create a function that takes a penguin object and returns an object
      that contains but ONE attribute, the graven image of that penguin</b></i></p>
    
    <p>The angel who sits at the right hand of the diety appeared and the light of knowledge shown down.</p>
    <pre>var (genPen)=function(penguin){var obj={picture:penguin.picture}; return obj:}</pre>
    <p>
      Twas so simple, so elegant.
      Kevin, eligable for sainthood now for his service, tests the function: classroom[0].picture
    </p>

      The demands of the deity become more capricious. <i><b>Expand the preious function so that the object it returns has both the picture
      attribute, BUT ALSO a NEW attribute called "quizMean", which is the mean of that penguin's quiz scores.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p> AH! I think, this will be easy! But I wrong.  .  . . In A3, we calculated the quiz mean for a given penguin.
