   We are so, so tired. But there is no rest for the wicked or the weary.         </p>
                        
    <p><i><b>Thou shalt create a function that takes a penguin object and returns an object
      that contains but ONE attribute, the graven image of that penguin</b></i></p>
    
    <p>The angel who sits at the right hand of the diety appeared and the light of knowledge shown down.</p>
    <pre>var picture=function(penguin){var obj={picture:penguin.picture}; return obj:}</pre>
    <p>
      Twas so simple, so elegant.
      Kevin, eligable for sainthood now for his service, tests the function: classroom[0].picture

      The demands of the deity become more capricious. <i><b>Expand the preious function so that the object it returns has both the picture
      attribute, BUT ALSO a NEW attribute called "quizMean", which is the mean of that penguin's quiz scores.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p> AH! I think, this will be easy! But I wrong.  .  . . In A3, we calculated the quiz mean for a given penguin and I know we must build on it. <br />
      I rushed to attend the holy office hour, only to realize I needed to clean up all my previous equations to make this one clear.

    <pre>var twopqobjs=function(penguin)
 {return picture, meanQuiz;}</pre>

        The stairs to heaven begin to seem slippery. <i><b>With one line of code, return a list of objects that contain the picture and meanQuiz of all penguins.</b></i>
        I once again give thanks for the D3.
        var answer=d3.select(classroom.map(meanQuiz), classroom.map(picture))

My child is hungry, my mother lost to the fog. But there will be nothing until the work is complete.

    <i><b>Tell me everything!<i/></b>

      <pre>  var testGrade= function(test)
    {return test.grade;}
    
    var meanTests= function(penguin)
    {var pq=penguin.test.map(testGrade);
    var answer=d3.mean(pq);
    return answer;}
    
   var HWGrade=function(homework)
    {return homework.grade;}
    
    var meanHW=function(penguin)
    {var pq=penguin.homework.map(HWGrade);
    var answer=d3.mean(pq);
    return answer;}
    
    var finalGrade=function(final)

    }
    
    var genInfo=function (penguin)
    {
    return [picture, meanQuiz, meanTests, meanHW, finalGrade];
    }

        var answer=genInfo; </pre>

    Now comes the great debate - to drink Red Bull at 11pm or push thru without. I opt to go without because I will need to rest my weary brow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The diety whispers, with a gleam in his eye. . .<i><b>Now do it all with one line of code</i></b>
