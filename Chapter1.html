      A1 <br />
   <i>   And then the great diety said, "Create a funtion to get the grade from a quiz object". </i>                   
    </p>
    <p>
       And because they were a kind diety, the answer was given as such:
    </p>
    <pre>var getGrad=function(quiz) {return quiz.grade;}</pre>
    <p>
    The function could be tested with: 
    </p>
    <pre>getGrade(classroom[0].quizes[0])</pre> 
    <p>
    Where the "0" references the first item in the data sets given <br />
    i.e. classroom[0] is the first penguin in class and quizes[0] is the first quiz of said penguin.
    </p>
  <p>
    But what <i>is</i>this function thing? <br />
    The Murray text, <u>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</u>, paints a lovely image on page 85 that values want to be held in the 
    "kind, caring function's" curly brackets. Without the function they are undefined, with no true path in this world.
    </p>
  
<p>
  A2 <br />
  <i>One quiz grade is not enough! You must find the mean of the quiz grades for the first penquin - who will henceforth be known as "Kevin"</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, the diety assisted with the creation of this kind, caring function. A new tool was given. <b>THE GREAT D3</b>.<br />
  <pre>var data=classroom[0].quizes.map(getGrade) var finalAnswer=d3.mean(data)</pre>
  
  </p>
<p>
  In the first question, we used Kevin as an example to retrieve his quiz grade and saved it in a variable named "getGrade". Now Kevin's mean
  quiz grades must be calculated with two new tools - map and d3.mean. Kevin = classroom[0] and his quizzes are mapped to getGrade so that the mean
  can then be calculated and returned.
</p>
  
  <p>
    A3 <br />
    <i> The mean of quizzes for Kevin is not enough! You must now creat a function to find the mean quiz grade for any of the penguins!</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this manner we were taught to create the world of penquin. 
  </p>
  <pre>var getPenguin=function(penguin){var pq=penguin.quizes.map(getGrade); var answer=d3.mean(pq); return answer;}</pre>
  <p> 
    And it can be tested with our faithful Kevin.
  </p>
  <pre> var answer=getPenguin(classroom[0])</pre>
